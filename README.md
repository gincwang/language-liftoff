This is a business/clinical website I created and designed for an allied health practitioner. To find out more, please visit www.languageliftoff.com

###Background
This is my first real-world website that I deployed under a real domain. I worked closely with the client on their requirements to make sure my website design suited them.  I aimed to help the client create a website that is simple in appearance (without cluttering information/content) and easy to navigate, while ensuring that all devices have a great viewing experience.

###Motivation
This website was created as an opportunity to learn about React JS and flux architecture. The following highlights a few libraries/concepts I've utilized during this project: 
* React JS
* React-Router
* alt (flux library)
* ES6 syntax through Babel
* Webpack
* using inline-styles for React JS
* no CSS files except for bootstrap.css
* Radium for inline-styling different component states
* Bootstrap
