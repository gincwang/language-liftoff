This is an informational website for my wife's private speech and language clinic, to find out more please visit www.languageliftoff.com

I wanted to create this website as an opportunity to learn about how React JS works, so here are the few libraries/concepts I've played with in this project:
* React JS
* React-Router
* ES6 syntax through Babel
* Webpack
* using inline-styles for React JS
* no CSS files except for bootstrap.css
* Radium for inline-styling different component states
* Bootstrap
