<span>"My 2Â½-year-old, Evan, doesn't talk at all. He doesn't respond when I call his name. He turns the pages of a book, but doesn't pay any attention when I read to him. He shows me what he wants, but doesn't use words. He doesn't do what I ask him to do. He gets upset when I don't understand him. Is this normal? Does he just need more time to catch up?"</span>,
<span>Don't wait and hope your child will outgrow a communication problem. Early detection leads to early treatment. The earlier you get help for your child, the better. </span>,
<span>Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and audiologists can help your infant or toddler who has a speech, language, or hearing disorder. SLPs help with <strong>language disorders, speech sound disorders, stuttering (disfluency), and voice disorders.</strong></span>
