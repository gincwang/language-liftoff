This is a business/clinical website I created and designed for an allied health practitioner. To find out more, please visit www.languageliftoff.com

This website was created as an opportunity to learn about React JS and flux architecture. The following highlights a few libraries/concepts I've utilized during this project: 
* React JS
* React-Router
* alt (flux library)
* ES6 syntax through Babel
* Webpack
* using inline-styles for React JS
* no CSS files except for bootstrap.css
* Radium for inline-styling different component states
* Bootstrap
